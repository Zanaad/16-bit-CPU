# 16-bit-CPU
## Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of a CPU, focusing on a systematic approach to understanding the fundamental components and operations of a central processing unit. The CPU design encompasses the architecture of the data path, control unit, and memory interfaces. 

## Key Features
- ALU: A versatile 16-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit capable of performing various arithmetic and logical operations, essential for executing instructions efficiently.
- Control Unit: Responsible for interpreting instruction opcodes and generating corresponding control signals to orchestrate the CPU's operations effectively.
- Register File: Comprising four 16-bit registers, including a dedicated zero register, this feature enables efficient data storage and retrieval during instruction execution.
- Memory Architecture: The design includes separate Instruction and Data Memory, each with a capacity of 128 bytes, allowing for the storage of program instructions and data.
